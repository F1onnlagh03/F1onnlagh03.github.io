  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a student at the University of Edinburgh currently in my fourth year on a five year course, MSc Astrophysics.
  I'm particularly interested in cosmology, computer modelling and data analysis.  My goal is to contribute to ongoing research in astrophysics, particularly in astroparticle physics, cosmology and galaxy evolution.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outwith academia, I have gained valuable teamwork and communication skills through a variety of hospitality roles which have strenghtend my efficiency and adaptability in research enviroments.  I also have a passion for triathlons, in particular running, where I am developing the important transferable skills determination, consistency, reliability and resilience.
